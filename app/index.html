                Hi, my name is
                <span>Christina</span> Nguyen (pronounced ["ŋwĩəŋ"] or ["win"], as in "You
                <span>will</span> never
                <span>win</span> if
                <span>you</span> never begin."). As a web developer, my learning path is never
                <span>over.</span> I love that front end development has made the web my empty canvas, and I am fascinated with the
                problem-solving power of back end. My coding journey started with Ruby on Rails until I landed a front end
                developer role as my first job in the industry. Building web pages for many different brands has honed my skills
                in jQuery, HTML, and CSS. I am aiming to master the ubiquitous MEAN stack in my short future. I am originally
                from California and now live in Miami, Florida. Changing career paths into technology has been
                <span>the best</span> decision of my life, and I am incredibly grateful to be making a living doing something I am
                passionate about. If you are looking for a
                <span>developer</span> with an eye for detail and who is hard-working, I hope
                <span>you will</span> contact me. I want to help you build whatever is your dream. I think that the world can greatly
                benefit from growth of technology and continue to make information more accessible.
                <span>Ever</span>y project is a new chance for me to practice these skills, learn more from the technology, and from
                the people you
                <span>work with</span>.

                DEv Rant: we have SO many meeting rooms. so many in this office. why do people think using the dining tables as a meeting
                room acceptable? This is some long
                <span>text</span> with some words that might turn up
                <span>more important</span> than other words. The
                <span>interesting</span> part about this idea, is that you can
                <span>hide keywords</span> in the actual text you're reading. Like this,
                <span>on hover</span>, you can actually
                <span>just show the keywords</span>.

                I wonder if you can take serveral videos of me hoop-dancing to a song and edit the opacity and layer them so you could make
                poi patterns. it would be like using double hoops with out doubles and that way I could catch more intense
                movements to express the parts of the songs i like. Sleepwalker should draw the antispin and the flowers together
                and vertical hooping with isolations, and weaves with other slower weaves. I need to look up how they combine
                videos with the same background and splice together to make twins.
